# Setup

1. Learn Python by completing this online tutorial: <https://www.learnpython.org/> (3 hours)
2. Create a GitHub account at <https://github.com/>
3. Setup git by following <https://help.github.com/en/articles/set-up-git> (30 minutes)
4. Learn git by completing the [Introduction to GitHub](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/introduction-to-github) tutorial, reading the [git handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/), then completing the [Managing merge conflicts](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/managing-merge-conflicts) tutorial (1 hour).
5. Install the Python data science stack from <https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/> . **We will use Python 3** (30 minutes)
6. Complete the scikit-learn tutorial from <https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/machine-learning-python> (2 hours)
7. Understand how python packages work by going through the [Python Packaging User Guide](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/) (you can skip the "Creating Documentation" section). (1 hour)
8. After I have created all the project repositories you can then clone your private class repository
```
git clone https://github.com/iit-cs579/[github-username].git
```
E.g., for me this would be:
  ```
   git clone https://github.com/iit-cs579/aronwc.git
  ```
  - You should have read/write (pull/push) access to your private repository.
  - This is where you will submit assignments.
  - **Note:** This step will not work until I have setup your private repository. This usually happens by the second week of the semester (and this is why I need you to complete the course survey).

See <https://github.com/iit-cs579/assignments> for instructions on submitting assignments.
