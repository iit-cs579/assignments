# Setup

1. Learn Python by completing the online Python training course at <https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python>.

2. Learn git by completing the online training course at <http://try.github.io> and/or watching https://trevordmiller.com/courses/real-world-git

3. Install the Python/SciPy stack on your computer (if you haven't already) by follwing the instructions here: <http://continuum.io/downloads>. We'll be using Python 3.6, **not** Python 2.

4. Install and Setup Git: <https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/>

5. Clone your private class repository
```
git clone https://github.com/iit-cs579/[github-username].git
```
E.g., for me this would be:
  ```
   git clone https://github.com/iit-cs579/aronwc.git
  ```
  - You should have read/write (pull/push) access to your private repository.
  - This is where you will submit assignments.
  - **Note:** This step will not work until I have setup your private repository. This usually happens by the second week of the semester (and this is why I need you to complete the course survey).

See <https://github.com/iit-cs579/assignments> for instructions on submitting assignments.
