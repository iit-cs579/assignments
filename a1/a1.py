# # CS579: Assignment 1
#
# In this assignment, we'll implement community detection algorithms using Facebook "like" data.
#
# The file `edges.txt.gz` indicates like relationships between facebook users. This was collected using snowball sampling: beginning with the user "Bill Gates", I crawled all the people he "likes", then, for each newly discovered user, I crawled all the people they liked.
#
# We'll cluster the resulting graph into communities.
#
# Complete the methods below that are indicated by `TODO`. I've provided some sample output to help guide your implementation.


# You should not use any imports not listed here:
from collections import Counter, defaultdict, deque
import copy
from itertools import combinations
import math
import networkx as nx
from numpy.linalg import eigh

def bfs(graph, root, max_depth):

    Perform breadth-first search to compute the shortest paths from a root node to all
    other nodes in the graph. To reduce running time, the max_depth parameter ends
    the search after the specified depth.
    E.g., if max_depth=2, only paths of length 2 or less will be considered.
    This means that nodes greather than max_depth distance from the root will not
    appear in the result.

        The third and final step is to calculate for each edge e the sum

        path to that node. This credit may be divided among nodes and
